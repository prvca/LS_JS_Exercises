'hi'
'hello'

The program logs 'hi' because in the bar function, the property 'a' of the
object, foo, which is passed into the function, is reassigned to the value 'hi'.

It then logs 'hello'. Primitive values such as strings are not mutable, therefore
the string value passed in as argument2 cannot be reassigned to 'hi'. Instead, the
variable argument2 is reassigned to 'hi'.
