It logs:

Product2
Product3
Product not found!



It logs 'Product2' to the console, because the value passed into the serial variable matches the value of case '113' and therefore executes the statement associated with that clause.

Then because there is no break statement, the execution keeps going and it executes the code from case '142' and the default case.
