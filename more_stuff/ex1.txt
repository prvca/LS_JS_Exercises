The code logs:
[1, 4, 3]

This happens because array1 and array2 are both pointing to the same array, also the same location in memory. So when we reassign the element with the index of 1 in array1, array2 is also affected because the variable points to the same array.


/*
let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
let array2 = array1;
array1[1] = 4;
console.log(array2);
*/
